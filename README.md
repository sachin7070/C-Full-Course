## 1. Introduction to C++

### Explanation:
C++ is a powerful and widely used programming language known for its efficiency and versatility. Developed by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, C++ supports both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms and is used extensively in various domains such as systems programming, game development, and high-performance applications.

### Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
Hello, World!
